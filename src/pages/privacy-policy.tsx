        <p>
          We may collect personal identification information from Students in a
          variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Students enroll
          in the Institutes or a Course within the Institutes, subscribe to a

          features, or resources we make available in our Institutes. Students
          may visit the Institutes anonymously. We will collect personal
          identification information from Students only if they voluntarily
          submit such information to us. Students can refuse to supply personal
          identification information but doing so may prevent them from engaging
